# The Capacitive Sensor Piano - Arduino Project
First year projects allowed me to study and apply engineering and programming at a more advanced level. One of the most relevant projects I worked on was designing and developing a piano for deaf people. While researching, my team and I discovered that vibrations of mechanical systems are the physical cause of music, and thought we could use this concept to create a musical experience for the hearing impaired using the Arduino microprocessors. On this note, we designed the piano in such a way that each tile was associated with a higher or lower vibration, following its musical note. We also incorporated LEDs of different colours, as visual cues.
