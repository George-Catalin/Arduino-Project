# The Capacitive Sensor Piano - Arduino Project
First year projects allowed me to study and apply engineering and programming at a more advanced level. One of the most relevant projects I worked on was designing and developing a piano for deaf people. While researching, my team and I discovered that vibrations of mechanical systems are the physical cause of music, and thought we could use this concept to create a musical experience for the hearing impaired using the Arduino microprocessors. On this note, we designed the piano in such a way that each tile was associated with a higher or lower vibration, following its musical note. We also incorporated LEDs of different colours, as visual cues. 
# Materials Used 
Paper Clip / Transparent Tape <br/>
A4 Paper <br/>
Pencil <br/>
Speaker <br/> 
Resistors (1M OHM) <br/>
Breadboard <br/>
LEDs <br/>
Male-to-Male Jumper Wires <br/>
Arduino UNO
# The Capacitive Touch
It is easy to use and can be used instead of a button. <br/>
For every tile built it is required just one wire connected to it. <br/>
It can detect a finger from a few inches away using more powerful resistors. <br/>
It is cheap.
# The Code
There can be implemented a lot of cool ideas on the pattern that was done (there is an easter egg added) <br/>
Relatively short <br/>
Fairly easy to understand
